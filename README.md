# Flight-Deals
A python program to search for flights to desired cities using various APIs

By using the Sheety(for Google Sheets) and Tequila (for flights) APIs, as well as the Twilio library for their api, I can check for flights to any pre-defined destinations.

Here are the environment variables that you will need to add to your own system for this to work for you:

LOCAL_AIRPORT: The IATA code for your outgoing airport
MY_NUM: Your phone number for sms messages
SHEETY_KEY: Your Sheety api key
SHEETY_URL: Your Sheety url with your username
TEQUILA_KEY: Your Tequila key
TWILIO_AUTH: Your Twilio authentication key
TWILIO_NUM: Your Twilio number for outgoing
TWILIO_SID: Your Twilio SID

Once you have setup these environment variables for yourself, you will be able to get this program to work for you
